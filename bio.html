        Spike Jonze (born Adam Spiegel in New York City) is one of the
        most original and creative filmmaker of his generation. Jonze started
        his career directing some of the coolest skateboarding videos ever made.
        He then quickly became a very prolific music video director and made many
        iconic music videos in the late 90's and early 00's. He made his film
        feature debut in 1999 with "Being John Malkovich" and since then, he
        directed many bold and interesting films. Spike Jonze's
        body of work is definitely worth discovering for those of you who never
        had the chance to.
